# Events Class

This PHP class handles the operations for creating, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) events. It needs other software to display the events and to pass data to Events for creating new events or updating existing events.

Some basic functionality is provided here which demonstrates the usage of Events. Displaying events and filtering them prior to display are considered here as well as attaching them to the output of the Calendar class for display in calendar format.
